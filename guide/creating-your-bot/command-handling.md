# Command handling

Unless your bot project is small, it's not a very good idea to have a single file with a giant `if`/`else if` chain for commands. If you want to implement features into your bot and make your development process a lot less painful, you'll want to implement a command handler. Let's get started on that!

Here are the base files and code we'll be using:

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item index.js
```js
const { Client, Events, GatewayIntentBits } = require('discord.js');
const { token } = require('./config.json');

const client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds] });

client.once(Events.ClientReady, () => {
	console.log('Ready!');
});

client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, async interaction => {
	if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;

	const { commandName } = interaction;

	if (commandName === 'ping') {
		await interaction.reply('Pong!');
	} else if (commandName === 'beep') {
		await interaction.reply('Boop!');
	}
});

client.login(token);
```
:::
::: code-group-item deploy-commands.js
```js
const { REST, Routes } = require('discord.js');
const { clientId, guildId, token } = require('./config.json');

const commands = [];

const rest = new REST({ version: '10' }).setToken(token);

rest.put(Routes.applicationGuildCommands(clientId, guildId), { body: commands })
	.then(data => console.log(`Successfully registered ${data.length} application commands.`))
	.catch(console.error);
```
:::
::: code-group-item config.json
```json
{
	"clientId": "123456789012345678",
	"guildId": "876543210987654321",
	"token": "your-token-goes-here"
}
```

## Individual command files

Your project directory should look something like this:

```:no-line-numbers
discord-bot/
├── node_modules
├── config.json
├── deploy-commands.js
├── index.js
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
```

Create a new folder named `commands`, which is where you'll store all of your commands.

We'll be using utility methods of the library to build the slash command data.

First, create a commands/ping.js file for your ping command:

```js
const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require('discord.js');

module.exports = {
	data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
		.setName('ping')
		.setDescription('Replies with Pong!'),
	async execute(interaction) {
		await interaction.reply('Pong!');
	},
};
```

You can go ahead and do the same for the rest of your commands, putting their respective blocks of code inside the `execute()` function.

::: tip
You need at least one slash command created in a `commands` folder to continue with the instructions on this page. If you haven't done that yet, refer to [the previous pages in this section](/creating-your-bot/slash-commands.md).

## Loading command files

Now that your command files have been created, your bot needs to load these files on startup. 

In your `index.js` file, make these additions to the base template:

```js {1-2,8}
const fs = require('node:fs');
const path = require('node:path');
const { Client, Collection, GatewayIntentBits } = require('discord.js');
const { token } = require('./config.json');

const client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds] });

client.commands = new Collection();
```

We recommend attaching a `.commands` property to your client instance so that you can access your commands in other files. The rest of the examples in this guide will follow this convention. For TypeScript users, we recommend extending the base Client class to add this property, [casting](https://www.typescripttutorial.net/typescript-tutorial/type-casting/), or [augmenting the module type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html#ambient-modules).

::: tip
- The [`fs`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) module is Node's native file system module. `fs` is used to read the `commands` directory and identify our command files.
- The [`path`](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) module is Node's native path utility module. `path` helps construct paths to access files and directories. One of the advantages of the `path` module is that it automatically detects the operating system and uses the appropriate joiners.
- The <DocsLink section="collection" path="class/Collection" /> class extends JavaScript's native [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) class, and includes more extensive, useful functionality. `Collection` is used to store and efficiently retrieve commands for execution.
:::

Next, using the modules imported above, dynamically retrieve your command files with a few more additions to the `index.js` file:

```js {3-15}
client.commands = new Collection();

const commandsPath = path.join(__dirname, 'commands');
const commandFiles = fs.readdirSync(commandsPath).filter(file => file.endsWith('.js'));

for (const file of commandFiles) {
	const filePath = path.join(commandsPath, file);
	const command = require(filePath);
	// Set a new item in the Collection with the key as the command name and the value as the exported module
	if ('data' in command && 'execute' in command) {
		client.commands.set(command.data.name, command);
	} else {
		console.log(`[WARNING] The command at ${filePath} is missing a required "data" or "execute" property.`);
	}
}
```

First, [`path.join()`](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) helps to construct a path to the `commands` directory. The [`fs.readdirSync()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readdirsync_path_options) method then reads the path to the directory and returns an array of all the file names it contains, currently just `['ping.js']`. To ensure only command files get processed, `Array.filter()` removes any non-JavaScript files from the array. 

With the correct files identified, the last step is to loop over the array and dynamically set each command into the `client.commands` Collection. For each file being loaded, check that it has at least the `data` and `execute` properties. This helps to prevent errors resulting from loading empty, unfinished or otherwise incorrect command files while you're still developing.

## Receiving command interactions

Every slash command is an `interaction`, so to respond to a command, you need to create a listener for the <DocsLink path="class/Client?scrollTo=e-interactionCreate" /> event that will execute code when your application receives an interaction. Place the code below in the `index.js` file you created earlier.

```js
client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, interaction => {
	console.log(interaction);
});
```

Not every interaction is a slash command (e.g. `MessageComponent` interactions). Make sure to only handle slash commands in this function by making use of the <DocsLink path="class/BaseInteraction?scrollTo=isChatInputCommand" /> method to exit the handler if another type is encountered. This method also provides typeguarding for TypeScript users, narrowing the type from `BaseInteraction` to <DocsLink path="class/ChatInputCommandInteraction" />.

```js {2}
client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, interaction => {
	if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;
	console.log(interaction);
});
```

## Executing commands

When your bot receives a <DocsLink path="class/Client?scrollTo=e-interactionCreate" /> event, the interaction object contains all the information you need to dynamically retrieve and execute your commands!

Let's take a look at the `ping` command again. Note the `execute()` function that will reply to the interaction with "Pong!".

```js
module.exports = {
	data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
		.setName('ping')
		.setDescription('Replies with Pong!'),
	async execute(interaction) {
		await interaction.reply('Pong!');
	},
};
```

First, you need to get the matching command from the `client.commands` Collection based on the `interaction.commandName`. Your <DocsLink path="class/Client">`Client`</DocsLink> instance is always available via `interaction.client`. If no matching command is found, log an error to the console and ignore the event.

With the right command identified, all that's left to do is call the command's `.execute()` method and pass in the `interaction` variable as its argument. In case something goes wrong, catch and log any error to the console.

```js {1,4-16}
client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, async interaction => {
	if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;

	const command = interaction.client.commands.get(interaction.commandName);

	if (!command) {
		console.error(`No command matching ${interaction.commandName} was found.`);
		return;
	}

	try {
		await command.execute(interaction);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error);
		await interaction.reply({ content: 'There was an error while executing this command!', ephemeral: true });
	}
});
```

#### Next steps

Your command files are now loaded into your bot, and the event listener is prepared and ready to respond. In the next section, we cover the final step - a command deployment script you'll need to register your commands so they appear in the Discord client.
